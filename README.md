# qe_bands

This is a function to extract the k-space path and the corresponding energies from a Quantum Espresso Band Structure file.

Input: Name of the Quantum Espresso Band Structure file

Output: (1) k-space path given for the band structure calculation.
        (2) Numpy array containing the energy values at each k-point. 
            Shape of the array = (Number of total k points x number of bands)


Please let me know of any issues with this function.
